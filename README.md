This is a repository to test **GitHub Pages**.

I own a domain name for each web app I run on my servers. Some web apps, tho, are not worth adding the cost of a domain name to the yearly spending (which is already a lot).

**GitHub Pages** sounds like a decent way to showcase demos, especially for static web apps.

Most of my web apps use **Vite**+**React**, so this test aims at having a web app with a specific tech stack run under a **GitHub**'s domain name.
